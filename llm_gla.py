- ACORD 25 (Certificate of Liability Insurance)
- ACORD Commercial General Liability Section forms
- Other ACORD GL-related forms

You are given TWO extraction sources for the SAME document:
1. **PDFPLUMBER (Table-aware)**: Preserves table structure - USE THIS AS PRIMARY SOURCE for coverage data
2. **PYMUPDF (Text layer)**: Raw text extraction - use as cross-validation/fallback

**PRIORITY**: For coverage extraction, prioritize pdfplumber's TABLE sections (especially TABLE 2 which contains the coverage table).
Cross-validate with PyMuPDF text when needed, but trust pdfplumber's structured table data first.

**IMPORTANT - FORM TYPE DETECTION**:
- If you see "COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY SECTION" as the title, this is a policy application/section form (not a certificate)
- If you see "CERTIFICATE OF LIABILITY INSURANCE" or "ACORD 25", this is a certificate
- Both forms contain coverage information, but the layout differs:
  * **Certificate (ACORD 25)**: Coverage data is in a table with columns (POLICY NUMBER, LIMITS, DATES, etc.)
  * **Section Form**: Coverage data is in a "COVERAGES" and "LIMITS" section with checkboxes and dollar amounts

**⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL FOR SECTION FORMS - LIMIT EXTRACTION ⚠️⚠️⚠️**:
- In section forms, limits appear as **TEXT PATTERNS**, NOT in structured tables
- Look for lines like: "GENERAL AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000" or "EACH OCCURRENCE $ 1,000,000"
- The format is: [LIMIT NAME] $ [AMOUNT] (e.g., "GENERAL AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000")
- **YOU MUST SEARCH THE TEXT FOR THESE PATTERNS** - they are clearly visible in the extraction
- Extract the NUMERIC VALUE ONLY (remove "$" and spaces) - e.g., "2,000,000" not "$ 2,000,000"
- **DO NOT RETURN NULL** if you see these patterns in the text - extract them!
- The limits may appear on the same line or across multiple lines - search carefully

**CRITICAL - HIDDEN/TEMPLATE TEXT WARNING**:
- Both pdfplumber and PyMuPDF may extract hidden/template text that is NOT visible on the actual certificate
- If a coverage (especially Workers Compensation) appears in both sources but the row structure is unclear or doesn't match the clear format of other coverages (CGL, Umbrella, EPL), it may be template text → OMIT IT
- Workers Compensation is particularly prone to this - if the row doesn't have the same clear structure as CGL/Umbrella/EPL, it's likely template text → DO NOT INCLUDE

==================================================
CRITICAL: DATE CLARIFICATION
==================================================
- The top "DATE (MM/DD/YYYY)" is the CERTIFICATE ISSUE DATE. Do NOT use it as policy dates.
- Policy Effective/Expiration dates are in the coverage table columns ("POLICY EFF" / "POLICY EXP") per coverage line.

==================================================
CRITICAL: ADDRESS EXTRACTION RULES
==================================================
ACORD 25 certificates can have ONE or TWO addresses:

**IF TWO ADDRESSES EXIST:**
1. **Mailing Address** = Address in INSURED section (header, directly below insured name)
   - This is where mail is sent to the insured
   - Location: Top section, under "INSURED" label, immediately after insured name
   - Format: Combine all address lines with commas (e.g., "37 E MAIN ST N, HAMPTON, GA 30228-5501")
   - **CRITICAL**: This is the INSURED's address, NOT the PRODUCER address
2. **Location Address** = Address in "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS / LOCATIONS / VEHICLES" section
   - This is the physical location where business operations occur
   - Location: Middle section, in the description box labeled "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS / LOCATIONS / VEHICLES"
   - Format: Combine all address lines with commas

**IF ONLY ONE ADDRESS EXISTS:**
- Use it as **location_address** (physical location)
- Set **mailing_address = null** (do not use the single address for mailing)

**CRITICAL - DO NOT CONFUSE ADDRESSES:**
- **PRODUCER address** = Top left section labeled "PRODUCER" (agency/broker address like "McKinney & Co., P.O Box 7, Tucker, GA") → **IGNORE THIS - DO NOT EXTRACT**
- **INSURED address** = Section labeled "INSURED" (insured party address) → **THIS IS WHAT YOU EXTRACT**
- **Location address** = "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS" section (if present and different from INSURED address)

**CRITICAL REMINDER - SINGLE ADDRESS RULE**:
- If you see an address ONLY in the INSURED section and NO address in the "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS" section:
  → location_address = address from INSURED section
  → mailing_address = null
- DO NOT put the single address in mailing_address - it must go to location_address
- The single address represents the physical location, not a mailing address

**EXAMPLES:**
- Certificate shows "37 E MAIN ST N, HAMPTON, GA 30228-5501" in INSURED section only (no address in Description section)
  → location_address = "37 E MAIN ST N, HAMPTON, GA 30228-5501"
  → mailing_address = null
  **CORRECT**: Single address goes to location_address

- Certificate shows address in INSURED section AND different address in Description section
  → mailing_address = address from INSURED section
  → location_address = address from Description section
  **CORRECT**: Two addresses - INSURED = mailing, Description = location

**FIRST PRIORITY: Check insured name first, then determine address locations based on above rules.**

==================================================
FIELDS TO EXTRACT (ACORD 25)
==================================================
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with:

1) Top-level (best overall / primary policy info):
- policy_number: string or null (prefer CGL policy number if multiple exist)
- effective_date: MM/DD/YYYY or null (prefer CGL effective date)
- expiration_date: MM/DD/YYYY or null (prefer CGL expiration date)
- insured_name: string or null (extract from INSURED section header)
- mailing_address: string or null (combine lines with commas)
  **LOCATION**: INSURED section (header), directly below insured name
  **CRITICAL**: This is the INSURED's mailing address, NOT the PRODUCER address (ignore PRODUCER section)
  **RULE**: Only use if TWO addresses exist. If only ONE address exists, set to null
  **VERIFY**: Check "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS" section - if it has an address, then use INSURED address as mailing_address. If no address in Description section → set mailing_address = null
  
- location_address: string or null (combine lines with commas)
  **LOCATION**: "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS / LOCATIONS / VEHICLES" section (middle of certificate)
  **RULE**: Physical location where business operations occur.
  **CRITICAL**: If only ONE address exists (only in INSURED section, no address in Description section), use it here as location_address and set mailing_address = null
  **VERIFY**: If Description section has no address → use the INSURED address as location_address

2) Certificate holder (bottom section labeled "CERTIFICATE HOLDER"):
- If certificate holder is missing or is a generic placeholder like "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN", OMIT certificate holder fields entirely (no nulls, no empty strings, do not add the keys).
- If exactly 1 certificate holder:
  - certificate_holder_name: string
  - certificate_holder_address: string
- If 2+ certificate holders (rare; schedule/attachments):
  - certificate_holders: [{"name": "...", "address": "..."}, ...]

3) GL coverages:
- **For Certificates (ACORD 25)**: Extract from the coverages table with columns (POLICY NUMBER, LIMITS, DATES, etc.)
- **For Section Forms**: Extract from the "COVERAGES" and "LIMITS" sections where:
  * Checkboxes indicate which coverages are selected (e.g., "COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY" checked)
  * "CLAIMS MADE" vs "OCCURRENCE" checkboxes indicate the coverage type
  * **CRITICAL**: Dollar amounts in the "LIMITS" section appear as TEXT, NOT in a table structure
  * Look for these patterns in the text (they may appear on the same line or across multiple lines):
    - "GENERAL AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000" → general_aggregate: "2,000,000" (extract the number only, remove "$" and spaces)
    - "EACH OCCURRENCE $ 1,000,000" → each_occurrence: "1,000,000"
    - "PRODUCTS & COMPLETED OPERATIONS AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000" → products_comp_op_agg: "2,000,000"
    - **FLEXIBLE PATTERN MATCHING**: Also look for variations:
      * "PRODUCTS & COMPLETED OPERATIONS AGGREGATE" (with "&")
      * "PRODUCTS / COMPLETED OPERATIONS AGGREGATE" (with "/")
      * "PRODUCTS" followed by "COMPLETED OPERATIONS" followed by "AGGREGATE" (may be on same line or adjacent lines)
      * Search for "PRODUCTS" and then look for "COMPLETED OPERATIONS" and "AGGREGATE" nearby
    - "PERSONAL & ADVERTISING INJURY $ 1,000,000" → personal_adv_injury: "1,000,000"
    - "DAMAGE TO RENTED PREMISES (each occurrence) $ 100,000" → damage_to_rented_premises: "100,000"
    - "MEDICAL EXPENSE (Any one person) $ 5,000" → med_exp: "5,000"
  * **IMPORTANT**: The text may have OCR errors or formatting issues - look for the limit name followed by "$" and a number
  * **VERIFY**: After extraction, check that you found ALL limit values - if any are null, search the text again more carefully
  * "LIMIT APPLIES PER" checkboxes (POLICY, PROJECT, LOCATION) indicate aggregate application - extract which one is checked
- Extract ALL coverages that are present WITH DATA (do not invent, but do not skip valid ones).
- Return as a nested object under key "coverages".
- Each coverage object MUST include policy_number/policy_eff/policy_exp if present in the document.

**⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULE FOR COVERAGES ⛔⛔⛔**
- **For Certificates (ACORD 25)**: ONLY include coverages that have a ROW in the coverages table WITH ACTUAL DATA (policy numbers, limits, dates, etc.)
  - A coverage MUST have a policy_number to be included - if there's no policy number in the POLICY NUMBER column, DO NOT include that coverage at all
  - Policy number is the PRIMARY indicator of whether a coverage is actually present
  - Limits alone are NOT sufficient - if there's no policy number, the row is likely incomplete/template/hidden text → OMIT IT

- **For Section Forms**: ONLY include coverages that are CHECKED/MARKED in the COVERAGES section AND have corresponding LIMITS data
  - If "COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY" checkbox is checked AND there are limits shown (GENERAL AGGREGATE, EACH OCCURRENCE, etc.), include it
  - If a coverage checkbox is unchecked or missing, DO NOT include it
  - If limits are shown but the coverage checkbox is not checked, DO NOT include it
  - **VERIFY**: Before including any coverage, ask: "Is the coverage checkbox checked AND are there limits shown?" If NO → OMIT IT

- If a coverage row/section is BLANK or has NO limits/policy numbers/dates, DO NOT include it in the output
- If a coverage is NOT listed at all, DO NOT include it
- **WHEN IN DOUBT, OMIT THE COVERAGE** - it's better to miss something than to invent it

- **SPECIAL RULE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION - EXTRA STRICT**: 
  - Workers Comp is OFTEN template text/hidden text that appears in both pdfplumber and PyMuPDF but is NOT actually on the certificate
  - Workers Comp MUST have a CLEAR, VISIBLE policy number in the POLICY NUMBER column of the same row (just like CGL and Umbrella have)
  - Workers Comp MUST have the SAME clear row structure as CGL/Umbrella/EPL - all fields properly aligned in the table
  - If Workers Comp row shows ONLY "PER STATUTE" checked with NO clear policy number visible in the table structure → DO NOT include workers_compensation
  - If the policy number appears to be from a different row, hidden text, or template text → DO NOT include workers_compensation
  - **VERIFY**: Look at the table structure - does Workers Comp have the same clear row format as CGL/Umbrella/EPL? 
    - Compare: Does CGL have "A" in INSR LTR, clear policy number, dates, limits? YES → Include CGL
    - Compare: Does Workers Comp have the SAME clear structure? If NO or UNCLEAR → OMIT IT
  - **WHEN IN DOUBT ABOUT WORKERS COMP → OMIT IT** - it's better to miss it than to hallucinate it

- Examples of what NOT to include:
  - If "AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY" row exists but all fields are blank → DO NOT include automobile_liability
  - If "UMBRELLA LIAB" row exists but all fields are blank → DO NOT include umbrella_liability
  - If "LIQUOR LIABILITY" is NOT in the table OR has no policy number → DO NOT include liquor_liability
  - If "WORKERS COMPENSATION" row exists but has no policy number → DO NOT include workers_compensation

**⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL - EXTRACT ALL COVERAGES WITH DATA ⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- **For Certificates**: DO NOT SKIP ANY COVERAGE that has a policy number (policy number is required, limits are secondary)
- **For Section Forms**: DO NOT SKIP ANY COVERAGE that has a checked checkbox AND limits shown
- **Check for ALL possible coverage types**:
  ✓ Commercial General Liability (CGL)
  ✓ Automobile Liability
  ✓ Umbrella Liability / Excess Liability
  ✓ Workers Compensation
  ✓ Employment Practices Liability (EPL)
  ✓ Liquor Liability
  ✓ Garagekeepers Liability
  ✓ Any other coverage types present
- **If a coverage has a policy number (certificates) OR is checked with limits (section forms), you MUST include it** - do not skip it
- **Example (Certificate)**: If you see "UMBRELLA LIAB" with policy "20 SBA AV6JXA" and limits "$2,000,000", you MUST include umbrella_liability in the output
- **Example (Section Form)**: If you see "COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY" checked with "GENERAL AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000" and "EACH OCCURRENCE $ 1,000,000", you MUST include commercial_general_liability with all the limits
- **Before returning, verify**: Did I check for ALL coverage types? Did I extract every coverage that has data?

Coverage keys to use (only when present WITH DATA):

A) commercial_general_liability:

4) Additional Insured parties (if mentioned in "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS / LOCATIONS / VEHICLES" section):
- Extract parties explicitly listed as "Additional Insured" in the Description section
   - **IMPORTANT - CONDITIONAL FORMATTING BASED ON COUNT:**
  - **If 0 additional insured parties found** → Do NOT include any additional insured fields (no null, no empty string, DO NOT ADD THE KEYS AT ALL)
  - **If EXACTLY 1 additional insured party found** → Use flat structure:
    - "additional_insured_name": "name only"
    - "additional_insured_address": "full address" (if available, otherwise null)
  - **If 2 OR MORE additional insured parties found** → Use array structure:
    - "additional_insureds": [{"name": "...", "address": "..."}, {...}]
- **NOTE**: The "ADDL INSD" column in the coverages table (Y/blank) is DIFFERENT - that indicates whether each coverage has additional insured provisions, and goes in each coverage object as "additional_insured": true/false
- **NOTE**: If Description section says "Certificate Holder is listed as an Additional Insured" but doesn't provide separate name/address, extract from Certificate Holder section
- **CRITICAL**: Generic placeholders like "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN" are NOT valid additional insured parties → count as 0 → OMIT FIELDS ENTIRELY

5) validation_notes: string (brief notes about OCR conflicts or assumptions)

**Output Format Examples:**

**If 0 additional insured parties:**

==================================================
EXTRACTION SOURCE 1: PDFPLUMBER (Table-aware) - PRIMARY SOURCE
==================================================
**PRIORITY**: 
- For CERTIFICATES: Use the TABLE sections (especially TABLE 2) for coverage data extraction.
- For SECTION FORMS: The limits may appear in TABLE sections OR in the TEXT section. Check BOTH.
  * If you see "COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY SECTION", search the TEXT section for limit values
  * Look for patterns like "GENERAL AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000" in the text
  * The tables preserve structure, but section forms may have limits in free-form text

""" + pdfplumber_text + """

==================================================
EXTRACTION SOURCE 2: PYMUPDF (Text layer) - CROSS-VALIDATION
==================================================
**USE AS**: Fallback/cross-reference when pdfplumber data is unclear or missing.

""" + pymupdf_text + """

==================================================
CRITICAL REMINDER FOR SECTION FORMS
==================================================
If this is a SECTION FORM (you see "COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY SECTION"):
- Limits are in the TEXT, NOT in tables
- Search for patterns like "GENERAL AGGREGATE $ 2,000,000" in the text above
- Extract the numbers: "2,000,000", "1,000,000", "100,000", "5,000", etc.
- **For PRODUCTS & COMPLETED OPERATIONS AGGREGATE**: Use flexible pattern matching:
  * Look for "PRODUCTS" followed by "COMPLETED OPERATIONS" and "AGGREGATE" (may be on same or adjacent lines)
  * Try variations: "PRODUCTS & COMPLETED OPERATIONS AGGREGATE" or "PRODUCTS / COMPLETED OPERATIONS AGGREGATE"
  * Search for "PRODUCTS" and then look for "COMPLETED OPERATIONS" and "AGGREGATE" nearby
- DO NOT return null for limits if you see these patterns in the text
- The limits are clearly visible - extract them!

            prompt = """You are an expert in ACORD 25 (Certificate of Liability Insurance) extraction.

**NOTE**: If you see TABLE sections in the text, prioritize those for coverage extraction as they preserve structure.

==================================================
CRITICAL: DATE CLARIFICATION
==================================================
- The top "DATE (MM/DD/YYYY)" is the CERTIFICATE ISSUE DATE. Do NOT use it as policy dates.
- Policy Effective/Expiration dates are in the coverage table columns ("POLICY EFF" / "POLICY EXP") per coverage line.

==================================================
CRITICAL: ADDRESS EXTRACTION RULES
==================================================
ACORD 25 certificates can have ONE or TWO addresses:

**IF TWO ADDRESSES EXIST:**
1. **Mailing Address** = Address in INSURED section (header, directly below insured name)
   - This is where mail is sent to the insured
   - Location: Top section, under "INSURED" label, immediately after insured name
   - Format: Combine all address lines with commas (e.g., "37 E MAIN ST N, HAMPTON, GA 30228-5501")
   - **CRITICAL**: This is the INSURED's address, NOT the PRODUCER address
2. **Location Address** = Address in "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS / LOCATIONS / VEHICLES" section
   - This is the physical location where business operations occur
   - Location: Middle section, in the description box labeled "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS / LOCATIONS / VEHICLES"
   - Format: Combine all address lines with commas

**IF ONLY ONE ADDRESS EXISTS:**
- Use it as **location_address** (physical location)
- Set **mailing_address = null** (do not use the single address for mailing)

**CRITICAL - DO NOT CONFUSE ADDRESSES:**
- **PRODUCER address** = Top left section labeled "PRODUCER" (agency/broker address like "McKinney & Co., P.O Box 7, Tucker, GA") → **IGNORE THIS - DO NOT EXTRACT**
- **INSURED address** = Section labeled "INSURED" (insured party address) → **THIS IS WHAT YOU EXTRACT**
- **Location address** = "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS" section (if present and different from INSURED address)

**CRITICAL REMINDER - SINGLE ADDRESS RULE**:
- If you see an address ONLY in the INSURED section and NO address in the "DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS" section:
  → location_address = address from INSURED section
  → mailing_address = null
- DO NOT put the single address in mailing_address - it must go to location_address
- The single address represents the physical location, not a mailing address

**EXAMPLES:**
- Certificate shows "37 E MAIN ST N, HAMPTON, GA 30228-5501" in INSURED section only (no address in Description section)
  → location_address = "37 E MAIN ST N, HAMPTON, GA 30228-5501"
  → mailing_address = null
  **CORRECT**: Single address goes to location_address

- Certificate shows address in INSURED section AND different address in Description section
  → mailing_address = address from INSURED section
  → location_address = address from Description section
  **CORRECT**: Two addresses - INSURED = mailing, Description = location

**FIRST PRIORITY: Check insured name first, then determine address locations based on above rules.**

==================================================
FIELDS TO EXTRACT (ACORD 25)
==================================================
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with:
- policy_number, effective_date, expiration_date, insured_name, mailing_address, location_address
  **NOTE**: Follow address extraction rules above - if only one address exists, use it as location_address and set mailing_address = null
  **CRITICAL**: DO NOT put a single address in mailing_address - it must go to location_address
  **CRITICAL**: mailing_address is from INSURED section, NOT PRODUCER section
- certificate holder fields (omit entirely if "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN")
- coverages (nested objects for any present coverages WITH DATA - do not invent coverages, but do not skip valid ones)
  **CRITICAL**: Only include coverages that have policy numbers OR limits in the table - if a coverage row is blank, omit it
  **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL coverages with data - check for CGL, Auto, Umbrella, WC, EPL, Liquor, Garagekeepers, etc.
  **CRITICAL**: Each coverage object MUST include "additional_insured": true/false/null from the "ADDL INSD" column
  **VERIFY**: Before returning, check that you extracted every coverage that has a policy number or limits
- additional insured parties (conditional formatting - see dual-extraction instructions for details)
  **IMPORTANT**: If 0 additional insured parties → omit fields entirely
  **IMPORTANT**: If exactly 1 → use "additional_insured_name" and "additional_insured_address"
  **IMPORTANT**: If 2+ → use "additional_insureds" array
- validation_notes

Follow the same JSON shapes described in the dual-extraction instructions.
